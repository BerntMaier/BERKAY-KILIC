# YTU RACING PNEUMATIC PCB

Hello everyone! In this article, we will talk about the pneumatic PCB  we designed for our combustion vehicle YTR08C by YTU Racing in the Formula Student competition, the world's most prestigious undergraduate engineering competition, attended by university students from all over the world who are interested in motor racing

**About the Pneumatic**

In our combustion car, we use the pneumatic system to shift. To control shifting from buttons we have this design in our car. The valve which drives the pneumatic tube requires 24V. We solder a step-up PCB on top of our pneumatic PCB and it directly goes to the valve. When you press the button.  It gives 5V from ECU which pulls the MOSFET gate high. Then it activates the valve and it shifts.

**How to order PCB at JLCPCB;**

This design is sponsored by JLCPCB. After designing the circuit however you want, you can order your PCB and get it to your hand in a short time! We would like to thank JLCPCB for their support and we are very satisfied with the service we received. First, you have to export GERBER and NC files of your PCB files. JLCPCB explained how to do it you can visit the website. They communicate very quickly in the PCB Gerber file or in case determination that may cause any problems in terms of production and deliver the PCB without any problems. After that put the files into a single RAR file then get to the order page You are even able to change PCB color for free. You can change the shipping method. JLCPCB ensures the delivery of PCB to your hand for 3 days! You can check the website of JLCPCB. We want to thank again to JLCPCB for the great quality of its service.

JLCPCB SMT Parts Library has 200k+ in-stock components (689 Basic components and 200k+ Extended components)

You can build your library Inventory, save parts for now or in the future Assembly which will be supported with 10M+ parts by Digikey, mouser, This benefits customers to source components much faster and easier, bringing you a shorter PCBA production time You can Get PCBA products in one week, from ordering, parts sourcing and PCBA prototyping Your PCBs are passing JLCPCB’s special tests such as inspection in JLCPCB’s high-tech facility and visual tests, X-ray test is used to check the quality of the solder joints (such as BGA) under the components on the line to ensure that the circuit board can achieve 100% test coverage, solder paste inspections, SPI which is checking in advance whether there is a lack of poor solder paste printing, AOI, the surface of the object can be checked correctly (but for objects hidden under the part or on the edge of the part) The solder joints may be out of reach) You can get your PCB soldered in many different ways such as hand-soldering, reﬂow soldering, and wave soldering. Your PCBs are produced on a first-class production line adopted with an advanced Yamaha automatic placement machine all those machines are equipped electric feeder, a 10 temperature zone lead-free reflow soldering, automatic printing machine. SMT production line has functioned such as sorting, rectification, cleaning, literacy, and production line discipline management.

**Thank you, JLCPCB!**
